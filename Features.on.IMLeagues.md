### Next Game
To look at your next game, you may click on “Game Page” button that would direct you to next page, including your opponent’s team and individual stats. However, keep in mind that if your next game is for the playoff bracket, you will not be able to access through the “Game Page” button since this team was not from your league.

### Regular Season Schedule
On this section, you will be able to see the fixtures for your league table game. For Purdue’s soccer intramural league, every team will have the chance to play 3 games to determine the slots for the playoff bracket. You may click on each game to see your opponent’s stats before the game. If the game is already played, you may access the page again to see your team’s and individual performances.
