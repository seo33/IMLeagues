The best option here would be to do a **brief survey**, which is answering one question. This would lead you to the IM Leagues page without any ads. However, “Take a brief survey” option is **not always** available. Since IM Leagues page is known for their notorious amounts of ads like in figure 6, just be prepared to navigate the page with ads following you everywhere like the image below.
