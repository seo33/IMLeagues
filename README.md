IM League is used by more than 1000 colleges in America including Purdue University. Students who partake in Purdueâ€™s intramural activities know what IM Leagues is, but not many are informed about how the website can be accessed and used. Through my extensive user-research, I have created a tutorial for Purdue University students to access and utilize the features on the website.
